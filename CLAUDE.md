You're working in a macOS app in Xcode called Dayflow.
You are not able to build/run the app. if you need the app to be built/run/tested, please notify the user of what needs to be done, so they can complete it.
Remember, you can directly access the sqlite db, to help debug.

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
NEVER create extensions on classes that need to access private properties. Instead, add the methods directly to the class for proper encapsulation.
